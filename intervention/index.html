<p>
    I chose discord as the site of mu intervention. I chose it since you are able to make groups with people to chat with
    and I find that interteisng since you can chat with many differnet people just behaving this group even if you do not know
    them or have there phone number all you ahve to do is just join the group and you can chat with people.
    My intervention was to make an account using a fictional character and interact with people and see how they would respond 
    to taht cahracter would they dislike me becuase of that cahracter or would they treat me normaly This took place on Saturday.
    The effect was not what I expected since we talked about a game called clash of clans then we got into talkinga about food 
    which suprosed me I was even aclled a nice perosn even though my caracter was a villian in a fictional show so this was suprising.
    If I had more time I would go to more servers and see how the people woudl react so I could collect more data and see what would happen.
