<h1>Pictures in the code </h1>
<h4> Curated by Ryan brophy</h4>
<p>My exhibition will focus on net art that are pictures made from code or other algorithms from a computer. These pictures relate to one another since they were made on a computer and not on a canvas like normal paintings. They are also made form numbers and symbols which is different than other paintings that use colors or make an image. What makes them similar is the fact that they were made using only a computer and they are not something you would typical make anywhere else like on a canvas, paper or any other writing material or surface that someone would paint on.
